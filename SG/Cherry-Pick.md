The Cherry-Pick command allows you to 'apply' certain commits from
another branch to the current branch.

In SmartGit, there are several places from which you can initiate a
cherry-pick:

  - **Menu and toolbar** On the main window, select
    **Branch|Cherry-Pick** to open the **Cherry-Pick** dialog, where you
    can select one or more commits to cherry-pick. Depending on your
    toolbar settings, you can also open this dialog via the
    **Cherry-Pick** button on the toolbar.
  - **Log Graph** On the Log graph of the **Log** window, you can
    perform a cherry-pick by right-clicking on one or more commits and
    selecting **Cherry-Pick** from the context-menu.
