# Purchase Upgrades

There are 2 kinds of purchasing licenses for SmartGit, the perpetual
license and the subscription license. When purchasing perpetual
licenses, you will get at 1, 2 or 3 years or "life-long" updates
combined with 90 days, 1, 2 or 3 years support - depending on the option
you choose. This means, you can use any version of SmartGit (if not
having ordered the life-long option: that has been release up to 1, 2 or
3 years after the purchase date), including all belonging bugfix
releases.

If this update period is expired, you still continue to use SmartGit,
but it will be unsupported and you won't be able to use newer versions
of SmartGit. To renew the support and update period, you need to
purchase upgrade licenses. Basically, upgrade licenses are the same as
new perpetual SmartGit licenses, but for a discounted price.

The easiest way is to use **Help|Register** in SmartGit and click the
**Purchase Update** button. Alternatively, you may open
<http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/purchase-update> in your browser and
upload your existing license file.

## Additional Seats

If you want to add additional seats to your perpetual SmartGit license,
you have following options:

  - order the additional licenses independent of the existing ones -
    that way you will have different license files with different
    support and update periods - or
  - also update your existing SmartGit licenses (their support and
    update period will restart) by uploading your license file at
    [syntevo.com/smartgit/purchase-update](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/purchase-update)
    and increasing the seat count to the overall required seat count.
