# Subscription Licenses

Subscription licenses are valid only for a certain period. They renew
automatically which requires a payment type that can be renewed
automatically, e.g. credit card or Paypal. After each successful
subscription payment you will get an email with the latest SmartGit
license file. You will need the latest SmartGit license file to register
a new copy of SmartGit - an older, already expired license will not
work.

SmartGit 6.5 or newer will check for updated subscription licenses
periodically and more frequently towards the end of the subscription
period, so usually the user will not notice subscription
management/update at all. This will require SmartGit to have access to
the internet and, if necessary, a correctly configured proxy
configuration in SmartGit.

Instead of ordering one subscription license for multiple users, you may
order single-user licenses for explicitly named users. That way you
easily can cancel subscriptions of users who leave your company.

## Increase the Number of Licenses

If you want to increase the number of subscription licenses, you have
following choices.

  - Just order the additional licenses. This way you will have two (or
    more) licenses running.
  - Cancel the running subscription and if the licenses expire after one
    month, order the new overall subscription license count.

## Decrease the Number of Licenses

If you want to increase the number of subscription licenses, you may
cancel the running subscription and if the licenses expire after one
month, order the new overall subscription license count.
